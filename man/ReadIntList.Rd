\title{Load hardcalls for multiple variants as an integer matrix.}
\usage{
ReadIntList(pgen, variant_subset)
}
\arguments{
\item{pgen}{Object returned by NewPgen().}

\item{variant_subset}{Integer vector containing 1-based indexes of variants
to load.}
}
\value{
Integer matrix, where rows correspond to samples, columns
correspond to variant_subset, and values are in {0, 1, 2, NA} indicating
the number of hardcall ALT allele copies.  For multiallelic variants, all
ALT alleles are combined.
}
\description{
This function treats the data as diploid; you can divide by 2, and then
treat 0.5 as NA, if it's actually haploid.
